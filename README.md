### Two Operations
Two integer operations are defined as:
* *ADD_1* Increment the integer by *1*
* *MULTIPLY_2* Как Multiply the integer by *2*

Given an integer value *k*, determine the minimum number of operations it takes to get from *0* to *k* using the two operations specified above.

#### Example
*kValues[i] = 8*

Starting from *0*, add *1*, then multiply by three times. It takes a minimum of *4* operations to get to *8*, so store *4* in index 0 of the return array.

#### Function Description
Complete the function *getMinOperations* in the editor below.

*getMinOperations* has the following parameter(s): *kValues[n]*:the given *kValues*

#### Returns:
*int[n];* answers to a list of queries in the given order 

#### Constraints
*7 < n < 10*

*0 ≤ kValues ≤ 10¹⁶
